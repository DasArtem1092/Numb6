% INPUT
%           x: Input signal
%          Fs: Input sample frequency (Hz)

%  windowSize: Frame size (Sec)
%   prefilter: Preemphasis a.r. coefficients (default is [1])
%
% OUTPUT
%    buffered: Output signal split into frames
%       envel: RMS of each frame
%          Fs: Output sample frequency (Hz)

% Comments:
%   Overlap is fixed at 50%
