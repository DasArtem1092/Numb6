# labelSignal
`labelSignal`: Automatic annotation of timbre variation for monophonic musical instruments

## Requirements

It has been tested on Matlab R2015a + DSP Toolbox, but it should work even with older versions of Matlab. If it doesn't, please let us know.

## Repo content

### labelSignal.m

`labelSignal.m` is the main function. This does all the work.

### lib

`lib` contains functions used by the main function.

### example.m

`example.m` script is a good starting point to learn how to use `labelSignal.m`.

### inDepthExample.m

`inDepthExample.m` script is a good starting point to learn how `labelSignal.m` works.

### Other files
`Khomus.wav`: Audio file used by the sample scripts.
