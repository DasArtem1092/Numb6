# labelSignal

`labelSignal`: Automatic annotation of timbre variation for monophonic musical instruments and other sound sources.

## Examples

You can find some output examples [here](http://lim.di.unimi.it/demo/labelSignal.php).

## Requirements

It has been tested on Matlab R2015a + DSP Toolbox, but it should work even with older versions of Matlab. If it doesn't, please let us know.

## Repo content

`lib` contains routines used by the main function.

`labelSignal.m` is the main function. This does all the work.

`example.m` script is a good starting point to learn how to use `labelSignal.m`.

`inDepthExample.m` script is a good starting point to learn how `labelSignal.m` works.

`Khomus.wav` is some audio used by the sample scripts.

`README.md` is this file.
